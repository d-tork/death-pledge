HOUSE HUNTING MODULE

1. Get to where I can plug in an address and get back the walk score
2. Scrape the important stuff: 
	-URL
	-address
	-city, state
	-price
	-square footage
	-bedrooms, bathrooms
	-year built
3. Get commute time from citymapper (at specific times)
4. Stats on neighborhood: crime, school distances, bus stops(?), median income, median age, gender breakdown, education
5. Need to have a pre-evaluation score (based on pure stats/numbers scraped), and a post-evaluation score (after I've been able to look through photos closely, or else visit myself)
6. Export in format that can be dragged into Google Maps
	with clusters! And ratings!
7. Write lat/lon coordinates and full address w/ zip back to google sheets (saves me on the API calls)


More difficult: 
1. parking
2. washer/dryer
3. rating the kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, neighborhood, backyard
